# NomCom-Requirements

The NomCom process is defined in [RFC 8713](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8713.html). [Section 3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8713.html#name-nominating-committee-princi) states that

> The NomCom will be given the titles of the positions to be reviewed and a brief summary of the desired expertise of the candidate that is selected to fill each position.
 
This means that each group with a position up for consideration (IESG, IAB, IETF Trust, IETF LLC) provides the NomCom with their summary of desired expertise. 

In the case of the IETF LLC, the requirements shared with the NomCom have been developed based on RFC 8711 and the document used in the past is available [here](https://github.com/ietf-llc/IASA2-Retrospective/blob/main/References/LLC%20Director%20Role%20Description.pdf), which are derived from the Board responsibilities in [RFC 8711](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html), [Section 4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-general-ietf-llc-responsibi) and [Section 5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-llc-board-responsibili).

The Board may additionally prioritize or emphasize certain skills and experience. For example, in the last NomCom cycle, the Board emphasized the need for non-profit fundraising experience based on the knowledge that a new funding agreement with ISOC was being negotiated, that this included a novel new fundraising matching program that the LLC wanted to leverage, that a role for a Director of Development needed to be defined and then recruited for, and that an initial new fundraising strategy and plan needed to be developed.

Consultation Action: As a result of discussions the IETF LLC Board has been having arising from the [IASA2 Retrospective](https://github.com/ietf-llc/IASA2-Retrospective/), the IETF LLC has proposed running a potentially annual process in advance of the start of annual NomCom nominations (usually late August) for the community to comment on the requirements that will be sent to the NomCom for IETF LLC director roles. This is an experiment to see if this is potentially a useful mechanism for feedback. 

Timing: Please provide feedback via email at admin-discuss@ietf.org or by opening issues or pull requests [here on GitHub](https://github.com/ietf-llc/NomCom-Requirements/blob/main/Draft-2022-NomCom-Requirements.md). This consultation opens 1 August 2021 and runs for two weeks, concluding on 15 August 2021.
